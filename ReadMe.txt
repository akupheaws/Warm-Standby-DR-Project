AWS Multi-Region Infrastructure with Terraform
This project provisions a highly available, disaster-resilient web application infrastructure across two AWS regions‚Äîus-east-1 (primary) and us-west-2 (secondary)‚Äîusing Terraform.

üìÅ Project Structure
The infrastructure is organized into modular phases:

Phase 1: VPC & Networking ‚Äì Sets up VPCs, subnets, NAT gateways, and route tables.

Phase 2: EC2 & Auto Scaling ‚Äì Deploys EC2 instances with launch templates and auto scaling groups.

Phase 3: Load Balancers & RDS ‚Äì Configures Application Load Balancers and RDS instances.

Phase 4: Backup & Disaster Recovery ‚Äì Implements AWS Backup plans with cross-region replication.

Phase 5: Route 53, CloudFront & WAF ‚Äì Establishes DNS failover, content delivery, and web application firewall.

üß± Modules Overview
VPC Module: Creates VPCs, subnets, and networking components in both regions.

EC2 Module: Defines launch templates and auto scaling groups for web and application tiers.

Load Balancer Module: Sets up Application Load Balancers and target groups.

RDS Module: Provisioning of Multi-AZ RDS instances with subnet groups.

Backup Module: Configures AWS Backup plans and vaults with cross-region replication.

Route 53 Module: Establishes DNS records with health checks for failover.

CloudFront Module: Deploys a CDN distribution for content delivery.

WAF Module: Applies web application firewall rules to protect the application.

üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations
